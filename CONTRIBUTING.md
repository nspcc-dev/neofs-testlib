# Contribution guide

First, thank you for contributing! We love and encourage pull requests from
everyone. Please follow the guidelines:

- Check the open [issues](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testlib/issues) and
  [pull requests](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testlib/pulls) for existing
  discussions.

- Open an issue first, to discuss a new feature or enhancement.

- Write tests, and make sure the test suite passes locally.

- Open a pull request, and reference the relevant issue(s).

- Make sure your commits are logically separated and have good comments
  explaining the details of your change.

- After receiving feedback, amend your commits or add new ones as appropriate.

- **Have fun!**

## Development Workflow

Start by forking the `neofs-testlib` repository, make changes in a branch and then
send a pull request. We encourage pull requests to discuss code changes. Here
are the steps in details:

### Set up your GitHub Repository
Fork [NeoFS testlib upstream](https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testlib/fork) source
repository to your own personal repository. Copy the URL of your fork and clone it:

```shell
$ git clone <url of your fork>
```

### Set up git remote as ``upstream``
```shell
$ cd neofs-testlib
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-testlib
$ git fetch upstream
```

### Set up development environment
To setup development environment for `neofs-testlib`, please, take the following steps:
1. Prepare virtualenv

```shell
$ virtualenv --python=python3.10 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install all dependencies:

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Setup pre-commit hooks to run code formatters on staged files before you run a `git commit` command:

```shell
$ pre-commit install
```

Optionally you might want to integrate code formatters with your code editor to apply formatters to code files as you go:
* isort is supported by [PyCharm](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15434-isortconnect), [VS Code](https://cereblanco.medium.com/setup-black-and-isort-in-vscode-514804590bf9). Plugins exist for other IDEs/editors as well.
* black can be integrated with multiple editors, please, instructions are available [here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html).

### Create your feature branch
Before making code changes, make sure you create a separate branch for these
changes. Maybe you will find it convenient to name branch in
`<type>/<issue>-<changes_topic>` format.

```shell
$ git checkout -b feature/123-something_awesome
```

### Test your changes
Before submitting any changes to the library, please, make sure that all unit tests are passing. To run the tests, please, use the following command:
```shell
$ python -m unittest discover --start-directory tests
```

To enable tests that interact with SSH server, please, setup SSH server and set the following environment variables before running the tests:
```
SSH_SHELL_HOST = <address of the server>
SSH_SHELL_LOGIN = <login that has permissions to run python3 on the server>
SSH_SHELL_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = <path to SSH private key on your machine>
SSH_SHELL_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE = <passphrase for the SSH private key>
```

### Commit changes
After verification, commit your changes. There is a [great
post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) on how to write useful commit
messages. Try following this template:

```
[#Issue] Summary
Description
<Macros>
<Sign-Off>
```

```shell
$ git commit -am '[#123] Add some feature'
```

### Push to the branch
Push your locally committed changes to the remote origin (your fork):
```shell
$ git push origin feature/123-something_awesome
```

### Create a Pull Request
Pull requests can be created via GitHub. Refer to [this
document](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for
detailed steps on how to create a pull request. After a Pull Request gets peer
reviewed and approved, it will be merged.

## DCO Sign off

All authors to the project retain copyright to their work. However, to ensure
that they are only submitting work that they have rights to, we are requiring
everyone to acknowledge this by signing their work.

Any copyright notices in this repository should specify the authors as "the
contributors".

To sign your work, just add a line like this at the end of your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Samii Sakisaka <samii@nspcc.ru>
```

This can easily be done with the `--signoff` option to `git commit`.

By doing this you state that you can certify the following (from [The Developer
Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)):

```

```

## Code Style
We use `black` and `isort` for code formatting. Please, refer to [Black code style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html) for details.

Type hints are mandatory for library's code:
 - class attributes;
 - function or method's parameters;
 - function or method's return type.

The only exception is return type of test functions or methods - there's no much use in specifying `None` as return type for each test function.

Do not use relative imports. Even if the module is in the same package, use the full package name.

To format docstrings, please, use [Google Style Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html). Type annotations should be specified in the code and not in docstrings (please, refer to [this sample](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#type-annotations)).

## Editable installation
If you would like to modify code of the library in the integration with your test suite, you can use editable installation. For that, in virtual environment of your test suite (not in the virtual environment of the testlib itself!) run the following command (path to `neofs-testlib` directory might be different on your machine):
```shell
$ pip install -e ../neofs-testlib
```

# Maintaining guide

## Versioning
We follow [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) to version this library. To manage version number in the source code, we use [bumpver](https://pypi.org/project/bumpver/) package.

To update a version of the library, please, take the following steps:
1. Make sure that your have no pending changes in git.
2. Run the following command to update version and commit it to git:
    ```shell
    $ bumpver update --major   # to update major version
    $ bumpver update --minor   # to update minor version
    $ bumpver update --patch   # to update the patch component of the version
    ```
3. Sign-off the created commit:
    ```shell
    $ git commit --amend --signoff
    ```
4. Push the changes to remote.
5. After this commit is merged to upstream, create a tag on the master branch of upstream. Tag name should be formatted as "v{new_version}":
    ```shell
    $ git tag v<new_version>
    $ git push upstream v<new_version>
    ```

## Building and publishing package
To build Python package of the library, please run the following command in the library root directory:
```shell
$ python -m build
```

This command will put wheel file and source archive under `dist` directory.

To check that package description will be correctly rendered at PyPI, please, use command:
```shell
$ twine check dist/*
```

To upload package to [test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/neofs-testlib/), please, use command:
```shell
$ twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
```
It will prompt for your username and password. You would need to [create test PyPI account](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) in order to execute it.

To upload package to actual PyPI, please, use command:
```shell
$ twine upload dist/*
```
It will prompt for your username and password. You would need to [create PyPI account](https://pypi.org/account/register/) in order to execute it.
